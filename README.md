## Hey, I'm Ananya 🌙  

✨ student developer  
🎓 writing code + rewriting errors since... let’s not talk about it  
💡 powered by caffeine, curiosity, and clean indentation  
🧩 lowkey obsessed with neat UIs and even neater logic  
🐞 still debugging life (but my C++ runs fine, thanks)

### 📂 what’s in my GitHub  

- 🧩 Mini projects that do more than they claim to  
- ✨ Some random magic made with logic

### 🧠 dev truths  

- 🔁 will run it 27 times before asking for help  
- 🚫 never trusts `while(!eof())`  
- 🤖 lowkey enjoys debugging more than socializing  
- ⌨️ Ctrl+Z is basically muscle memory  
- 🩹 adds “just for now” code that stays forever

### 📌 pinned ≠ everything  

- ✔️ if it’s on my GitHub — I built it  
- ✨ if it looks neat — I obsessed over it  
- 🔥 if it made me suffer — I probably learned a lot 🕯️  
- ⏳ still learning. still building. still showing up
